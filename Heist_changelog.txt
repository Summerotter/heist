Entry 2:
-Had inspiration, completed all of Roadmap 5 and a good portion of 6. 
-Changes character stats from individual attributes to a character.stats dict. Left names,cash,xp,inventory, alone for now.
-Hideout end_night_penalty done.
-Added max health/stam to character stats, modified versions of skill rolls, and low stam/health high stress penalty tracking
-added character.update_stats method to be called when resting.
-character stress changed to stress_handling, which allows it to be more=better like other stats.
-skills and stats split up into... skills and stats. Allows better iteration.
-added character.update_skill,.update_stat, .update_all methods.
-moved equipment to character.skills dict as string:val tupple.
-Finished end_night for Hideout and Home, left opening for Event system later.
-Overhauled Job class to include new modifiers seperate from base for manipulation
-Job hours now show up in menu. Base 1 hour takes 1 stamina. Maybe needs a bit of work for balance.
-New Event Manager, currently with job_event_table and job_event() method. Might actually use case_switch+lambda for the methods.
-Basic job events added for guide on how to handle events. If I standardize all the location classes, might be able to do single event_handler.
-Bank autodeduct modified as per stress change
-Roadmap 2 is complete, if untested and with a minimal event list.

Roadmaps:
-Roadmap 2: End of Day function for Home and Hideout, stamina/stress loss at work, work events. [Written, not tested, incomplete Event list]
-Roadmap 3: XP system and Skill/Stat Increases
-Roadmap 4: Market and Items, Bar, End Of Game/Victory (Purchased papers)
-Roadmap 5: Heist System skeleton designed [DONE]
-Roadmap 6: Heist System skeleton written [PARTIAL]
-Roadmap 7: Heist System fleshed out, would need more fluff
-Roadmap 8: Saving and Loading System with SQLAlchemy(?), Main Menu instead straight to city.menu()
-Roadmap 9: Polish the UI
