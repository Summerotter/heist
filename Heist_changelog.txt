2/7/2016:
Entry 1:
-Had inspiration, completed all of Roadmap 5 and a good portion of 6. 
-Changes character stats from individual attributes to a character.stats dict. Left names,cash,xp,inventory, alone for now.
-Hideout end_night_penalty done.
-Added max health/stam to character stats, modified versions of skill rolls, and low stam/health high stress penalty tracking
-added character.update_stats method to be called when resting.
-character stress changed to stress_handling, which allows it to be more=better like other stats.
-skills and stats split up into... skills and stats. Allows better iteration.
-added character.update_skill,.update_stat, .update_all methods.
-moved equipment to character.skills dict as string:val tupple.
-Finished end_night for Hideout and Home, left opening for Event system later.
-Overhauled Job class to include new modifiers seperate from base for manipulation
-Job hours now show up in menu. Base 1 hour takes 1 stamina. Maybe needs a bit of work for balance.
-New Event Manager, currently with job_event_table and job_event() method. Might actually use case_switch+lambda for the methods.
-Basic job events added for guide on how to handle events. If I standardize all the location classes, might be able to do single event_handler.
